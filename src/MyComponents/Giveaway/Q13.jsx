          Information submitted with an entry is subject to the Privacy Policy
          stated on the Bunk4Study website. Click here [link to privacy policy]
          to read the Privacy Policy. NOTE: a privacy policy might be optional.
          However, use of a privacy policy may be required based on the laws
          where you live or where your participants live, the type of promotion
          youâ€™re running when using third-party platforms or features from
          social media channels. One benefit of including PrivacyPolicy
          information is that you make clear to your participants how you will
          use their information.
